# Without this file "__init__.py" the tests in this directory will not be executed,
# for example NOT when you run the following command from the base directory:
# python -m unittest discover -s tests
# (and also not, i.e. without this file,  when you right click the "tests" directory in PyCharm to run all the tests)
